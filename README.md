# PROJECT BLINK
## Blink Detection for Health Monitoring
The project aims to calculate blink frequency to identify potential eye-related
diseases and anxiety issues, contributing to advancements in health monitoring.
It uses an IR sensor attached to an eyewear device, which detects blinks. The frequency and magnitude of the blinks is tracked by the attached esp-32 chip, and the data is transferred through a network to any connected mobile device.
